Once upon a time, I doodled on paper or magnetic drawing boards, emulating a game. A video game, that was actually a doodle drawn by a kid.

But now I can tell my computer to doodle, thousands of times faster than I ever could.

What should I do with this power?

Can I escape my other worldly responsibilities?
