# daydreams
a game -- or something like that -- for Ludum Dare 54.

this game is not quite a finished and good game. it is my hope to make it finished one of these days. or perhaps that is yet another dream of mine. :)

### more info

made with my custom game engine, [ponygame](https://github.com/HoneyPony/ponygame)

if you figure out how to compile this, congratulations! also you are now officially a pony. anyways I personally enjoy the build system in ponygame quite a bit. but, it is quite undocumented. it is my hope to make it documented one of these days. or perhaps that is yet another dream of mine. :)
